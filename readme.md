# Aspecom - Audacity spectrum comparer
This c# program allows you to compare two  audacity spectra. This might come useful when you want to see the difference between very similar files. 
I used it when writing my bachelor thesis to compare phoneme outputs of text to speech synthesizers.
To use it,  open Audacity,  save two spectra in txt format, import them in Aspecom  and press compare. The result will appear in the result text box.
